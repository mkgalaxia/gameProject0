Time abilities
	cost (75): rewinds  platforms, characters, and enemies position, health, and mana (except for the mana used to cast this) to where they were 3 seconds ago. It also destroys all projectiles
	cost (10+10t^2): the position of all platforms, enemys, projectile, and the character is held till the spell stops (I might change this to just make everything slow-mo instead)
	1st lvl only, cost (20): bring back destroyed platforms.
	If you think of any more write it down.

Items and mechanics:

enemys have a chance of dropping mana/time-sand that gives the MC some mana back
enemys have a chance of dropping some kind of item that heals the MC a bit when picked up
enchanted stopwatch\hourglass: saves your progress at checkpoints (I may want to add an extra mechanic to this item)
Pegasus Boots: gives MC a double jump
lightning in a bottle: same thing as mentioned under lightning.
ring of vitality: MC heals back health over time. Flavor text is "time heals all wounds"
some kind of purchasable health item
orb of protection: a bubble that shields you from the next hit
phoenix scroll: fires a tracker projectile that explodes on contact

If you think of any more write it down.

Enemies
ENEMYS CAN BE ADDED OR REMOVED AS NEEDED

snake - also drops from top of screen, jumps instead of walks.
archer - fires arrow in straight line
mole - comes out of the ground and either swipes or throws rock (doesn't have to be a mole. it's just a filler name)
bohemith - large enemy with club. approx. 2-3x larger than MC. has a charge and jumping strike that you can run under
falcon - dives down at an angle to drop rock/seed/whatever at you
skeleton - comes out of the ground, has more health than standard enemy, fire resistant
(1st lvl enemy only) moss - a short vesion of the standard enemy with more health, weak to fire. can climb. can fuse with other enemy to make a stronger version of thhat enemy.
dryad - jumps out of background, has a whip attack and leaf shield, more health than a regular enemy. weak to fire
spider - drops from above the screen. can climb and go upsidedown. has acid spray and bite that poisons.
